        "info": "Tune into your body and give it exactly what it needs. This yoga series has power flows to push you, chill flows to wind you down, and flows with a little bit of both to bring you into balance. Each sequence is crafted with time and energy output in mind, allowing you to pick the class your body truly needs on any given day. The Power classes have a faster pace and focus on building heat and linking breath to movement. The Chill classes are slower with longer holds and deeper stretches. For days when you can’t make up your mind, Power and Chill classes mix the best of both worlds. By finding a flow to match your energy, you’ll feel more balanced, grounded, and ready to take on the rest of your day.",

        "info": "Movement Rx is a dynamic vinyasa series designed to open up your body through flexibility and mobility work. When it comes to mobility, it’s move it or lose it — a lack of movement can cause fascial adhesions that restrict your range of motion over time. Movement Rx is designed to break those adhesions and release tension through five targeted classes that blend creative and challenging transitions, binds, balances, core work, and inversions. By breaking you out of your normal movement patterns, you’ll find a greater range of motion and a new sense of freedom in your body.",
